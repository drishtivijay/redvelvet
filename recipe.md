How to Make Red Velvet Cake step by step........


step 1. First preheat your oven to 350 F (176 C).Next let's make our cake batter. Start by creaming your butter and your white granulated or casted sugar together in a large bowl. Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to do this.

step 2. Now we add in our eggs one at a time. So drop one egg in,mix,once the egg is completely incorporated do the other egg. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as well as with a spatula.

step 3. Now we add in our cocoa powder. It is a good idea to run it through some kind of a sifter. Cocoa powder tends to get a bit lumpy. Then mix again and scrape the sides as needed. Throughout this whole process we don't want to over mix, just until things are incorporated. If we mix too much we will add too much air into the batter which can cause air pockets in our cake .

step 4. Now add in your vanilla extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vinegar. If you don't have buttermilk you can make some by taking just shy of one cup of regular milk and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and then let it sit out for about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and vanilla extract until combined.

step 5. Now we add in our oil to the buttermilk mixture. Next add in  about 2 to 2 1/2  tablespoon of red food colouring liguid. Now stir untill the mixturre is nice red color. Set that mixture aside for now. 

step 6. Next we will add our salt and baking soda to our flour. you can use cake flour or all-purpose flour. Cake flour tends to work a little bit better, but all-purpose works great too. Usee a whisk to combine those ingredients.

step 7. Next we will add in about half of our food coloring buttermilk mixture and about half of our flour mixture,then turn on the mixture and mix until just combined. Give the sides of the bowl to a good scrape, then complete the process until all the ingrediants have been mixed leaving you wish with a nice red velvet cake better.

step 8. Now we just fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch cake pans with equal with equal amount of cake better. Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pan and then dust them with cocoa powder or flour and I always add a little round cut of parchement papaer on the bottom too as an added precaution, and my nonstick pans are great,but I like to over do it. Also it is is goog idea to lighty tap the pan with the batter in it, this will alow any cake bubble to rise on the top, which helps to prevent air pockets, but some times it is un avoidable and you just get them, the combination of over the mixing, etc. But it won't effevt the taste of the cake at all! S o don't worry about it. Now bake those cakes for 20 to 30 min until when a toothpick comes out clean after pocking it in the middle. 

step 9. Now after the cakes come out of the oven let's leave them alone and allow them to cool in thier pans for about 20 min. After that we can remove them from their pans, remove the parchement paper and then let the cake completely cool in the rack. Afterwards you can place the cakes in the fridge and let them chill, which helps with the frosting step now, it's tottaly up to you.

step 10. Well now it is time to make our frosting, we will be using just a few ingredients,cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract, and of course powdered sugar.

step 11. Now combine the cream cheese, butter and vanilla extract into a large bowl and mix with the hand mixture until nice and smooth usually takes a few min. then slowly incorporate all of the pwdered sugar . You may need more or less depending on the consisitency that you want. Next just remove the beaters. Frosting is ready to go. At this point if the frosting is still to runny add more powdered sugar or just chill it for about 30 min, before frosting the cake.  

step 12. First we will trip the cake so it will be somewhat level. You can skip this level if you like. I just always use my bread knife to cut the top of the bottom layer, if you want to use the fondant I recommend cutting the top of the top layer as well, the end product will lock a bit better. Next add the bunch of frosting to the middle, then layer the top layer of the cake on. Then cover the whole cake with the frosting. Once done put the cake in the fridge for about 30 min. This is optional.

step 13. Now I want to make a heart shape cake topper. To do that I take my heart shape cake cutter and cut out a shar from the middle of that piece of cake that I have. Then  just place it on the top of the cake.Looks pretty neat right?

step 14. Now take the rest of your leftover cake and crumble it with your fingers. Then gently apply it to your cake sides or on topor skit this step. It is tottly up to you how you decorate your cake:) Use a piping bag or pipe frosting around the top of your hear if you like. You are done now place the cake in the fridgr for 2 hours before serving. Enjoy!
